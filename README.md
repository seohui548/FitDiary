## Hello, 

our project name is ‘FitDiary’ which provides people with a user-friendly platform to let them easily access information about fitness programs and help them set up an exercise plan accordingly.

As covid situation is gradually subsiding, more people are setting up their minds to exercise.

But where to start?

#### *Visit our ‘Fit Diary’ website.*

As you can see diverse workout categories are organized on the left side. You can check out the sessions by just clicking them.

What you would be able to notice is that some of them are already full. If the class is full, you can’t of course register for it, but if any vacancy arises you can sign up.



## Main Page 🙌

What you only have to do is click on the class icon, then the ticket comes up.

It has all the information about the class like the class name, meeting schedule, location, and the class size.

Also, you can find the add button on the right. You can register for the class and add it to your schedule by clicking it. Once you are enrolled, the notification comes up. And you can confirm that the number of enrollment has increased.

If you want to check your calendar, find the bookmark on the top right of the screen. Then click on ‘my diary’.

Okay, we’re on a my diary page, which is a personal workout calendar.

As you can see, the calendar is on a monthly basis and the classes that you’ve added are already automatically updated. If you want to micromanage your schedule by date, just click the date you want. And here are the classes scheduled for you.

That’s it! 😎

we hope that people can easily access information about diverse fitness programs and manage their schedule freely through this website.

Thank you!! 🍕
